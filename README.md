# Substack for Gloomberb

Your Substack subscriptions in [Gloomberb](https://github.com/gloom-sh/gloomberb) — inbox, per-publication archives, and full article reading without leaving the terminal.

```bash
gloomberb install substack
```

Then press `SUB` in the command bar.

## Signing in

The pane signs in with a Substack magic link, the same way the website does. The session is stored in Gloomberb's plugin persistence, scoped to this plugin.

## Terminal and desktop only

Substack's API sends no CORS headers, so the browser build at term.gloom.sh cannot reach it. The plugin declares `targets: ["cli", "tui", "desktop"]`, and the marketplace shows it accordingly.

## This used to ship with Gloomberb

It moved to its own repository so it can be released independently. Existing installs restore it automatically on first launch after upgrading; nothing is lost, and stored sessions and read state carry over because the plugin id is unchanged.

## Development

`gloomberb` and `react` are peer dependencies, never real ones — Gloomberb symlinks its own copies into every plugin directory so there is exactly one instance of each in the process. CI links the host the same way.

```bash
bun install
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/gloom-sh/gloomberb.git /tmp/gloomberb
bun install --cwd /tmp/gloomberb
ln -sfn /tmp/gloomberb node_modules/gloomberb
ln -sfn /tmp/gloomberb/node_modules/react node_modules/react
bun run typecheck && bun test
```
